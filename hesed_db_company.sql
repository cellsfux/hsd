Apparently that&rsquo;s the biggest real estate transaction in California history, smashing the previous record of $177 million. It&rsquo;s also the second most expensive home real estate deal in US history &mdash; behind only a $238 million transaction for a property in New York City.\r\nIncredibly, Beyonc&eacute; and JAY-Z actually got something of a deal, as the property was originally listed for $295 million. But with a combined net worth of $2.5 billion, the power couple likely had no problem securing a mortgage.\r\n\r\n- ADVERTISEMENT -\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home was designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Art collector William Bell, its previous owner, spent 15 years building the all-concrete structure. It sits on an 8-acre property overlooking Malibu&rsquo;s Paradise Cove.

It\'s the most expensive home ever sold in California and second most expensive real estate deal in the country,&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;reports.\r\nThe 8-acre concrete compound overlooks the Pacific Ocean in the exclusive Paradise Cove area and was designed by famed Japanese architect, Tadao Ando. The 40,000 square foot home doubles as an art museum as the property was commissioned by modern art collectors Bill and Maria Bell more than a decade ago. It\'s no surprise, then, that the superstars took to the estate as their private art collection is said to be quite impressive.\r\nThe Malibu project took almost 15 years to build. According to&nbsp;Morley Construction Co., the project\'s contractor, design qualities include a water feature and a pool while utilizing 7,645 cubic yards of concrete.\r\nIf you can believe it, Jay-Z and Beyonc&eacute; got somewhat of a deal on the estate as the property was quietly listed for $295 million, per TMZ.\r\nLet\'s take a look inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z\'s new abode looks out onto the Pacific ocean.

She&rsquo;s then asked which politicians she&rsquo;s talking about.\r\n\r\n- ADVERTISEMENT -\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;All of them. any of them.&rdquo; She replies, plainly.\r\nShe then adds, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of them are trying hard enough&hellip; They worry more about their party than they do about the people.&rdquo;\r\nDolly added the better approach would be &ldquo;If we just do what we felt was the right thing rather than who&rsquo;s going to lose or who&rsquo;s going to win this, or who&rsquo;s going to look better if they do this.&rdquo;\r\nIt&rsquo;s a bold departure from Dolly&rsquo;s usual approach to talking politics &ndash; but people on social media have reacted positively to the normally reserved superstar speaking out.\r\nMany fans said the same thing, writing &ldquo;Dolly for president&rdquo; while another pointed out that Dolly has never forgotten where she came from, always putting the needs of the people before anything else.\r\nDespite being well-known for her huge heart,&nbsp;charitable endeavours, and not being afraid to wade in and help those in need, she&rsquo;s famously shied away from really talking about how she aligns.\r\nIn fact, after appearing at the Emmy Awards in 2017 with her 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, Dolly shared the rule she tends to live by when it comes to speaking politics.\r\nAt the awards show, Jane and Lily went a little bit off script, lashing out at then President Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDolly Parton used to avoid talking politics - even after her 9 to 5 costars lashed out at Trump live onstage\r\n\r\nNot long after, Dolly told&nbsp;The Guardian, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be known by the company I keep, so to speak. I want to be my own individual self. If I&rsquo;ve got something to say, I&rsquo;ll say it, but I don&rsquo;t want to be dragged into it.&rdquo;\r\nShe added about the event with Jane and Lily, &ldquo;I just did not want everybody to think that whatever they think is what I think. I don&rsquo;t really like getting up on TV and saying political things. I don&rsquo;t even want to make a deal out of it, but I want people to know I&rsquo;m my own individual self.&rdquo;\r\nAs for her own political views, she knows what they are and that&rsquo;s good enough for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got as many Republican friends as I&rsquo;ve got Democrat friends and I just don&rsquo;t like voicing my opinion on things,&rdquo; she says.\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks. You can ruin a career for speaking out. I respect my audience too much for that, I respect myself too much for that. Of course, I have my own opinions, but that don&rsquo;t mean I got to throw them out there because you&rsquo;re going to p*ss off half the people.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n', 'dolly-parton-shocks-fans-by-breaking-one-of-her-oldest-rules---and-it\'s-met-with-calls-for-her-to-run-for-president', 'http://localhost/sylvain/public/uploads/hesed-sarl8631ba03be283907e8d87355eb0d575b6469768807434.jpg', 'https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dolly-parton-shocks-fans-breaking-145738527.html', '1', 'jison nongolola', '2023-05-21 04:08:25', '2023-05-21 10:27:24'),

You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors\' or issuing bank\'s approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account. Payment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account. Auto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us. Fraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes. Free Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation (\"Free Trial\"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers. No Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 14 or as otherwise specified below. Termination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your online account and terminating the&nbsp;subscription. Change in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service. Delinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you. 90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. About these Terms Third Party Beneficiaries and Conflicts.

United States (us): Defined Terms Applicable Yahoo Entity:&nbsp;Yahoo Inc. (Address: 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA). Minimum Age:13 years old BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.&nbsp;AGREEMENT TO&nbsp;ARBITRATE FOR U.S. USERS. YOU AND&nbsp;US&nbsp;BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (&ldquo;DISPUTE(S)&rdquo;), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS,&nbsp;YOU AND&nbsp;WE&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND&nbsp;WE&nbsp;ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that: Notice of Dispute.&nbsp;If either you or&nbsp;we intend to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to&nbsp;us&nbsp;should be sent either by mail to Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA; or&nbsp;disputes@yahooinc.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that we have in our records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration. Arbitration Procedure.&nbsp;The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the&nbsp;Commercial Arbitration Rules&nbsp;to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA\'s&nbsp;Consumer Arbitration Rules&nbsp;will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. Small Claims Court Option.&nbsp;As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court. Arbitration Location.&nbsp;Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California. Arbitration Fees and Expenses.&nbsp;We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later. Settlement Offers.&nbsp;We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award. Severability.&nbsp;If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others. CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. THESE TERMS DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY\'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR. JURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND&nbsp;WE&nbsp;AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND&nbsp;WE&nbsp;UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. Choice of Law.&nbsp;These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction. Forum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and us, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and we&nbsp;agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.
